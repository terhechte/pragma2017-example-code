# Unidirectional Data Flow Examples

These are examples of various implementations of the redux and react workflows in Swift. They're based on my talk:

[*Simplifying State by partially introducing unidirectional data flow in your codebase*](https://speakerdeck.com/terhechte/simplifying-state-by-partially-introducing-unidirectional-data-flow-in-your-codebase)

[from Pragma Conference 2017](http://pragmamark.org)

The code is examplatory. There're multiple different branches based on the different parts of my slides.


## master
The base branch (you're here)

## simplest_redux
A very simple implementation of Redux in Swift

## redux_reducer
Adding a proper reducer to the Redux implementation we saw earlier
  
## with_uistackview
Adding a stackview to emulate the basics of what react diffing does

## with_parentforms
Adding parent forms / subforms to our form in order to allow nesting stackviews
